machine learning project nr. 2 of the 42 curriculum

In this project DataScience x Logistic Regression, you will continue your exploration of Machine Learning by discovering different tools. The use of the term DataScience in the title will be clearly considered by some to be abusive. That is true. We do not pretend to give you all the basics of DataScience in this topic. The subject is vast. We will only see here some bases which seemed to us useful for data exploration before sending it to the machine learning algorithm. You will implement a linear classification model, as a continuation of the subject linear regression : a logistic regression. We also encourage you a lot to create a machine learning toolkit while you will move along the branch. 

Summarizing: 
- You will learn how to read a data set, to visualize it in different ways, to select and clean unnecessary information from your data. 
- You will train a logistic regression that will solve classification problem (The Hogwarts Sorting Hat)
